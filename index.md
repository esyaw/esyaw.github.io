**About me**

!(/assets/images/evaphd.png)

ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Eva

- PhD in material physics @ University College London, UK. 

- My research focuses on the synthesis and advanced characterisation of low dimensional materials. I am currently exploring the unique electronic properties of phosphorene nanoribbons (PNRs), given their promising role in shaping next-generation nanoelectronics and energy solutions.

Feel free to explore my academic and personal achievements here!

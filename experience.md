## Research

**PhD in Materials Physics**  
_September 2019 - January 2024_  
**University College London**, London, UK  
- Part of the CDT Advanced Characterisation of Materials (CDT-ACM) joint programme between UCL, Imperial College London, and Trinity College Dublin.
- Synthesis of materials using the metal-ammonia intercalation method, focusing on phosphorene nanoribbons (PNRs) and intercalation of 2D ferromagnet Cr2Ge2Te6.
- Probing local conductivity of PNRs using high-speed AFM (collaboration with Bristol Nano Dynamics Ltd)
- Characterisation techniques using AFM, TEM, Raman spectroscopy, XRD, ICP.
- Lab maintenance, building and changing faulty lab equipment


**Masters Research Project**  
_October 2018 - June 2019_  
**University College London**, London, UK  
- Investigated the growth of HfO2-based Ferroelectric Thin Films.
- Utilized radiofrequency magnetron sputtering technique for the deposition of epitaxial thin films of Zirconia-doped HfO2 on YSZ substrates.
- Studied crystal structures and ferroelectric properties using XRD, dielectric impedance spectroscopy, and polarization-field measurements.
  

**Summer Research Project**  
_July 2018 - August 2018_  
**Seoul National University**, Seoul, South Korea  
- Grew SnOx films to study their electrical properties through pulse laser deposition and atomic layer deposition.
- Assessed resistivity and Hall voltage across dielectrics using the Van der Pauw method.


**"Finding Nano" Summer School**  
_June - July 2017_  
**Technical University of Munich**, Munich, Germany  
- Focus: Nanoscience and Nanotechnology, Research and Industry in Germany
- Fabrication of nano-sized imprinted stamps using UV and thermal imprint method

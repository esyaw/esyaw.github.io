# Experience

## Research

**PhD in Materials Physics**  
_September 2019 - January 2024_  
**University College London**, London, UK  
- Part of the CDT Advanced Characterisation of Materials (CDT-ACM) joint programme between UCL, Imperial College London, and Trinity College Dublin.
- Synthesis of materials using the metal-ammonia intercalation method, focusing on phosphorene nanoribbons (PNRs) and intercalation of 2D ferromagnet Cr2Ge2Te6.
- Probing local conductivity of PNRs using high-speed AFM
- Characterisation techniques using AFM, TEM, Raman spectroscopy, XRD, ICP.
- Lab maintenance, building and changing faulty lab equipment


**Masters Research Project**  
_October 2018 - June 2019_  
**University College London**, London, UK  
- Investigated the growth of HfO2-based Ferroelectric Thin Films.
- Utilized radiofrequency magnetron sputtering technique for the deposition of epitaxial thin films of Zirconia-doped HfO2 on YSZ substrates.
- Studied crystal structures and ferroelectric properties using XRD, dielectric impedance spectroscopy, and polarization-field measurements.

**Summer Research Project**  
_July 2018 - August 2018_  
**Seoul National University**, Seoul, South Korea  
- Grew SnOx films to study their electrical properties through pulse laser deposition and atomic layer deposition.
- Assessed resistivity and Hall voltage across dielectrics using the Van der Pauw method.

## Teaching & Outreach

- March 2021 to March 2023: Undergraduate teaching assistant for "Solid State Physics" & "Properties of Matter" courses
- October 2021 to October 2022: Volunteered in Bridging the Future charity to help educational gaps for underprivileged students.
- February 2020 - present: Organized and participated in annual Physics & Astronomy day to celebrate artistic talents in the department and to inspire public interest in the sciences.

## Internship

**Bristol Nano Dynamics Ltd**  
- Performed market research and analysis to assess potential for high-tech scientific instrumentation.
- Collected and processed data for the company's prototype high-speed AFM system, contributing to product development insights.
